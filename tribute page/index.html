    <h3 id="headline">10 Most Celebrated Moments of M.S. Dhoni's Life:</h3>
    <p>The most celebrated skipper of the Indian cricket team, fastest and most accurate wicket-keeper and the master finisher, Dhoni celebrated his 39th birthday on 7th of July 2020 in his farmhouse at his hometown in Ranchi. While most of his journey from a young age to the day of him winning the World Cup in 2011 was displayed well in his biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story which is a must watch and must re-watch as well celebrating for many reasons including of course spectacular display of some of the most important parts of his life, we are going to pin down the most celebrated moments of Dhoni's life, let's see how many of them you knew being the fan of the right-handed middle-order batsman:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Time Playing Professional Cricket: </strong>Dhoni, a student who had no experience in professional cricket, was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) teams. There is an episode where Deval Sahay, an ex Bihar Cricket Association Vice President used to gift Dhoni with Rs. 50 for each six that he hit in Sheesh Mahal tournament.</li>

       <li> <strong>The under-19 match against Yuvraj Singh: </strong>Dhoni played against his future national squad teammate Yuvraj Singh in U-19s where for Bihar U-19s team he made 84 runs to support the total of 357 runs in finals of 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy and the Punjab U-19s team with young Yuvraj made 358 runs.</li>

      <li><strong>Being Picked for India v/s Pakistan Series: </strong>Dhoni enjoyed a record-breaking career as an International cricketer but believe it or not his life changed after he was picked for the Pakistan ODI series but on the second match of the series in 2005.</li>
      
      <li><strong>International Career Breakthrough with ODI knock-off: </strong>As Dhoni strolled down the pitch on his fifth one-day international, he carried the weight of a failed performance in his debut Bangladesh Tour in 2004 but he made sure that he silenced many waggling tongues with his memorable 148 knocks off 123 balls.</li>

      <li><strong>Preparing for 2007 World Cup and Disappointing Performances: </strong>At a crucial stage of his career, when he was made the captain of the Indian cricket team, the player was called out for being an unlikely captain. While the 2007 World Cup was in focus, he had some disappointing performances.</li>

      <li><strong>2007, Grabbing The T20 World Cup: </strong>In 2007, people hated the fact that the ICC World Twenty20 squad lacked players who Indian had put on a pedestal and celebrated the most, the bigwigs like Tendulkar, Dravid and Ganguly. Despite that, Dhoni held the inaugural World T20 Cup.</li>

      <li><strong>ODI, Test and IPL: </strong>As Dhoni rose through ranks and became the hottest player in ICC ODI, ICC test and Indian Premier League in the year 2009 from 2010, M.S. Dhoni was about to achieve the most celebrated moment of his life and millions of others as, India reached the finals of World Cup 2011 with victories over Australia and Pakistan in quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively.</li>

      <li><strong>… And Dhoni Finishes it Off In Style: Ind vs Eng World CUP 2011: </strong>On April 2nd 2011, Mahendra Singh Dhoni walked after the wicket of Virat Kohli and not only ease the pressure in the crucial innings, but as 4 runs were required, MS Dhoni's final six had the wild crowd of Wankhede collectively hold its breath until it landed amongst the crowd and brought India its 2nd World Cup Title after 28 years. Two things that brought him the 'Man of the Match' award that night and reward of being the person who paid homage to the God of Cricket, Sachin Tendulkar with that trophy that night was his tactical decision to come in at number 5 and his 91 not out.</li>

      <li><strong>M.S. Dhoni, The Untold Story: </strong>The biopic of Dhoni's journey from the day he was born to the day he held the world cup trophy with that swag and pride and the series of life events in between is called M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. The 2016 blockbuster Indian Hindi-language Sports biographical movie based on Dhoni's life starred late Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni along with many other film stars who either debuted or were already celebrated like Disha Patani and Anupam Kher.</li>

      <li><strong>The Bond of Real and Reel Dhoni Aka Late Sushant Singh Rajput: </strong>The movie showed various parts of his life, his ideology and celebrated the spirit of a boy from Bihar who not only made it to the Indian Cricket team but also brought the glory of World Cup to the country in 2011. Well, the movie also created a huge fan base of Sushant Singh Rajput, who belongs to Patna and made his name in the Bollywood.
